Siamese Fighting Fish Piano Game

This started as a group project, you can view the original game here:
https://github.com/iO-Academy/2022-jan-piano-game/tree/main

The project produced a keyboard you could play in your browser. There were extra stories that the group were unable to
do in the time allowed. I decided to finish the project on my own time.

Please find below docs for Piano Plinky Plonk. A 'pino hero' style game.
